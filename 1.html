  So, this happy pic of me was taken in 1999. I was a senior in college, and it was right after a dance practice. I was really,really happy.
  And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later.
  <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
  </p> <p style="margin-top:40px;">I was sitting in the back of my used minivan in a campus parking lot,
  when I decided I was going to commit suicide. I went from deciding to full-blown planning very quickly. And I came this close to the edge of the
   precipice. It's the closest I've ever come. And the only reason I took my finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.
   And after the fact, that's what scared me the most: the element of chance.</p>
